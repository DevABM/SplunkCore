In this module you learned about how you can use Cisco Packet Tracer to explore networking without having to purchase equipment or potentially disrupt an existing network. Packet Tracer (PT) simulates simple home networks, office networks, IoT networks, and even complex enterprise networks. Packet Tracer can be used to visualize a network as a logical topology and as a representation of the physical network.

This module contained several videos that you can access to help you improve your PT skills and your networking knowledge and skills. You explored additional features of PT, including configuring devices using the Config Tab, which is specific to PT, as well as learning the equivalent CLI commands to configure devices. For some end devices, the Desktop Tab gives you access to IP configuration, wireless configuration, a command prompt, a web browser, and other applications. Servers have a Services Tab which allows a server to be configured with common server processes such as HTTP, DHCP, DNS, etc.

You downloaded and installed Cisco Packet Tracer so that you could complete Packet Tracer Tutored Activity â€“ Logical and Physical Mode Exploration, which contained a hinting system and a built-in tutorial. Other PTTAs will contain hinting systems but will not have the tutorial.
